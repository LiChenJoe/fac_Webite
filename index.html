          </div>
            <h3>Why want to move into a web developer career?</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>✔️ Passionate about UI-friendly web design: When working on designing a web funnel as a digital marketer, I found I enjoy spending time finding an exciting and helpful new design and breaking down the important component. I don't have any technical background then but always want to know how that effect/design comes to life on the website.</li>
              <li>✔️ My passion for learning technology and continuous learning: My first web-building tool is WordPress, and I had a great time with it. But the more I use WordPress, the more I feel something is missing. I am eager to learn more about those tools and even the logic behind them.  </li>
              <li>✔️ Like to create things and solve problems: I used my free time to learn WordPress and enjoy the process of helping my client create a webpage from scratch. I know this is what I feel missing in the marketing job. I would be blessed to be put in a developed position that helps create something in demand. </li>
              <li>✔️ Eager to apply knowledge in web development to meaningful projects that make an impact: I am taking development courses on and off because I had been moving countries and finding new life. I am now settled and ready to open my new career chapter and build up the knowledge I need for creating a meaningful project in real life. </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Why Founder and Coder?</h3>
            <p>
             "Free bootcamp" and "job match", these are the two keywords I search on Google back in 2022.There are mayny options and I manage to focus one those have in-person event in London, which I believe can help me developer my communication skills, especially about how todiscuss the problem and explain my logic. Founder and Coder is one of them that standout, the welcoming community, online/in person pre-bootcamp events and the well design application process makes me believe its a organization is highly professional and will put effort on creating a friendly and helpful community.
